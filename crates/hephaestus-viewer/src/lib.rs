//! A desktop viewer for hephaestus plot documents.
//!
//! A `.hep` carries a plot's *configuration* rather than a picture of it, so
//! the thing to do with one on a desktop is re-solve it at the size of the
//! window it is shown in — resizing reflows, it does not scale. That is what
//! this is: a Tauri shell whose webview is chrome and canvas only, over a
//! native Rust core that reads documents and rasterizes them on the GPU.
//!
//! **There is no wasm here.** The two existing document consumers are browser
//! clients; this one links `hephaestus` natively, rasterizes through
//! `vello-hybrid`, and sends finished pixels to the webview. Because the
//! webview owns presentation there is no surface to share and no
//! `render_to_texture` path — [`Renderer::render_to_buffer`] normalizes to
//! straight alpha on both backends, which is byte-for-byte what canvas
//! `putImageData` wants.
//!
//! Two structural facts to know before reading anything else. A
//! [`PlotComposition`] is deliberately neither `Send` nor `Sync`, so one
//! thread owns every open document and everything else talks to it over a
//! channel ([`render`], [`channel`]). And **one window shows one document**,
//! which is what earns a native tab bar on macOS rather than a drawn one
//! ([`windows`]).
//!
//! [`Renderer::render_to_buffer`]: hephaestus::Renderer::render_to_buffer
//! [`PlotComposition`]: hephaestus::plot::PlotComposition
