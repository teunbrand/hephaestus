//! SVG output: a `SceneBuilder` that emits markup instead of pixels.
//!
//! Unlike the rasterising backends this implements [`SceneBuilder`] and
//! not [`crate::Renderer`] — `Renderer`'s contract is to fill a buffer
//! of RGBA8, and there are no pixels here. It needs no GPU and no
//! optional dependency, which is what makes a renderer-free
//! `document-read` + `svg` build possible.
//!
//! The emitter streams: draw calls append to a body buffer and any
//! `<defs>` they need accumulate beside it, with the whole document
//! assembled at write time. Recording first would mean holding a cloned
//! path and brush per draw — hundreds of megabytes for a dense scatter —
//! to produce a string that could have been produced incrementally.
//! Nothing needs a second pass: `<defs>` is written ahead of the body it
//! was discovered from, because the body is a `String`.
