//! Glyph runs to `<text>` — the reason this backend exists.
//!
//! # Why `textLength` and not per-glyph positions
//!
//! A run is placed by one `x`/`y` anchor plus `textLength`, following
//! svglite, rather than by pinning every character's x.
//!
//! Per-character positioning would assert something we have no basis
//! for. We know what *our* shaping did; we cannot know what a fallback
//! face on another machine ligates, how it clusters, or how it kerns.
//! Positions derived from our shaping would be wrong there — and the
//! spec additionally requires a renderer to break a ligature whose
//! characters carry absolute positions, so the text would come apart in
//! exactly the case the extra precision was meant to serve.
//!
//! `textLength` claims only the thing that is true regardless of face:
//! this run occupies this width. Everything inside it is the viewer's
//! own correct shaping.
//!
//! # Why one element per block
//!
//! Every run of a block goes into one `<text>` as sibling `<tspan>`s,
//! which is the canonical multi-line SVG idiom and Inkscape's own
//! representation. An editor imports one `<text>` as a **single text
//! object**; N sibling `<text>` elements import as N unrelated objects.
//! For output whose point is editability that difference is the whole
//! game. [`crate::scene::TextGroup`] is what says which runs belong
//! together.
